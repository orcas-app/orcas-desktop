# Add option to check for updates

Auto-updating has been implemented, but there is currently no way for the user to trigger an update (or even check that the app is up to date).

At the bottom of the settings page, add an 'Updates' section. This should show the current version of the app, and options to (1) check for updates and (2) install updates.
