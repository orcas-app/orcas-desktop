# Improve agent creation

- When the user chooses to create a new agent, immediately add the agent to the list in an empty state and put the user in 'Edit' mode for that agent
- Add the option for the user to delete an agent
- Instead of showing a warning when the user has unsaved changes, disable the 'Save changes' button when there are no unsaved changes, and re-enable when there are saved changes
