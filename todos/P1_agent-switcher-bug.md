# Agent switcher bug

There are two bugs with the agent switcher:
- Its background is transparent, making it hard to read
- When the user chooses an agent from the agent switcher, instead of taking the user to the conversation with that agent, they are taken to the full chat window agent selector and have to choose an agent again.
